# Project Guidelines 🚀

### Welcome to the A-Arch-Build Project! 👋

Here, we have **7 sub-branches** created for each of the members. Please make sure to **pull** and **push** your code into your respective branch. **Do not merge into `main`** before testing for conflicts! 🛑

### Branch Assignments:
- **Kaushalya**: `project-release` 📦
- **Dayana**: `inspection-release` 🔍
- **Banuja**: `finance-release` 💰
- **Harini**: `crm-release` 🛠️
- **Harishalinee**: `site-analysis-release` 🌍
- **Sowmiya**: `vendor-doc-release` 🗂️
- **Vidursha**: `construction-tracking-release` 🏗️

Please ensure that all code is thoroughly tested before attempting to merge it into the `main` branch! ✔️

Happy coding! 😄
